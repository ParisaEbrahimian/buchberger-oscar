 This repository demonstrates a **step-by-step implementation of the Buchberger ID (Indeterminate Division) algorithm**. 
 It is written in **Julia** using the **Oscar.jl** computer algebra system and is designed for students to **see the results of each step** of the algorithm clearly.

 
The following is the link to the Jupyter notebook, which contains:

- A function called `reduce_with_steps`.  
- Some examples, along with a comparison of the final results from `reduce_with_steps` with the values obtained from the function `reduce_with_quotients`.
